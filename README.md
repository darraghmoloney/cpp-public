Programming projects in C++

This repository shows some of the programming projects I've completed using C++.

<strong>5stest.cpp</strong> -> Given a start and end number, this program will tell how many numbers within that range contain the number 5.

<strong>tictac.cpp</strong> -> This is a simple implementation of a console tic-tac-toe game, which creates and prints a board, takes in the location of the next move, prints the correct character to that location after checking if it's available, and checks for all win conditions.

<strong>triangle.cpp</strong> -> This program takes in three inputs which are potential points of a triangle and calculates whether a valid triangle can be created. This program contains a method that returns a raw pointer as an equivalent alternative method of returning an array, just for practicing the use of pointers.

<strong>recurPower.cpp</strong> -> A recursive implementation of a function that finds the power of a given number and exponent, using n^0 == 1 as the base case and accounting for both positive and negative numbers. Adapted for C++ from a Khan Academy JavaScript code challenge.
